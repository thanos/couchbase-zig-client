## Conclusion

The Zig implementation provides a **solid foundation** with all essential KV operations and basic query support. It's **production-ready for applications** that primarily use:
- Document CRUD operations (including APPEND, PREPEND)
- Counter operations
- EXISTS checks
- N1QL queries
- CAS and durability
- Replica reads

**Version 0.1.1 added**: APPEND, PREPEND, EXISTS operations, environment variable configuration.

**Version 0.2.0 added**: Complete subdocument operations (lookupIn, mutateIn) with all 12 operation types.

**Version 0.3.0 added**: Complete view query operations with all view options and reduce support.

**Version 0.3.1 added**: Parameterized N1QL queries with positional and named parameters, SQL injection prevention, and query plan caching support.

For applications requiring subdocuments, analytics, transactions, or advanced features, additional implementation work is needed. See "Not Implemented" section and effort estimates above.
