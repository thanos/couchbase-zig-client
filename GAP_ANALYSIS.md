### Effort Estimates

To reach feature parity with libcouchbase:

1. **Subdocument operations**: 40-60 hours
2. **Analytics queries**: 20-30 hours
3. **Transactions**: 60-80 hours
4. **Views**: 30-40 hours

## Conclusion

The Zig implementation provides a **solid foundation** with all essential KV operations and basic query support. It's **production-ready for applications** that primarily use:
- Document CRUD operations
- Counter operations
- N1QL queries
- CAS and durability

For applications requiring subdocuments, analytics, transactions, or advanced features, additional implementation work is needed.
